#Welcome visitors 🖖

my name is Martin (:widder_astro:️), based in Hamburg. Looking forward to learn a lot obout web development. I'm a trained media designer for digital and printmedia but the last years i've been working in office organization and management. 
I used some of html and css during my career but looking forward to learn much more. In my free time I like to be outside or meet with friends. I'm interested in many things but DIY, Nature, board sport, my fiancée :grinsen: and international cuisine are my main interests.

__P.S. i like dogs.__
