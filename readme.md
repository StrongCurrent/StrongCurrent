### welcomeVisitors 🖖
My name is Martin ✨♈️✨, based in Hamburg. Looking forward to learn a lot about web development. I'm a trained media designer for digital and printmedia but the last years i've been working in office organization and management. I used some of html and css during my career but looking forward to learn much more.
